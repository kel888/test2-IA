Q1a. RPA isban open-source automation framework for acceptance testing and robotic process automation (RPA). 
It is an application and platform independent project with a growing ecosystem of external tools and libraries.
The source code for this framework can be accessed publicly through GitHub and the maintainers provide guidelines on how anyone can contribute to it.
Contributions to the framework can also be done in other ways too. Such as helping with the various tools and libraries displayed on Robot Frameworkâ€™s website, 
the curated awesome-robotframework list, or the Robot Framework Market Square.

One of the key features that draws users to this framework is its accessible and legible tabular syntax. This syntax can be used to create suites of tests or RPA tasks written in simple natural language phrases. It also provides capabilities that allow you to leverage existing built-in, external, or custom keywords for creating other reusable high-level keywords. While running this framework it automatically generates clear and detailed result logs and reports in HTML, and also useful XML output files for results post-processing.
The framework also has a tagging feature for categorizing tests or tasks, and can also be used to select which one should run next. It provides a command-line interface that allows easy installation into an existing continuous integration system or build infrastructure.
